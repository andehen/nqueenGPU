\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Using GPU for scientific computing has become very popular. For many problems, 
the massive parallelism that GPU offers, can give magnificent speedups compared to 
normal CPU's. In this paper I have investigated if GPU is usable for solving puzzles. 
TODO: Rewrite when project is done. Add summarizing result.

\section{Introduction}

The puzzle I will try to solve is the $n$-queens puzzle \cite{nqueen}. It is a simple
and well documented puzzle. The puzzle is to place $n$ queens on an $n \times n$ chess
board without any queen attacking another queen. The approach I will use is a state-space
search with backtracking. This approach relies on random searches with very variable running times.
By using GPU, we can run multiple searches in parallel and by then, have a greater chance of finding
a solution faster than running multiple searches on CPU sequentially. 

\section{The Algorithm}

TODO: Write pseudo code for the general algorithm. Explain.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Solution search}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{Objective Function}{$state$,$k$}
\For {\textbf{each} $row$ \textbf{and} $column$ \textbf{in} $state$}
    \State diff $+=$ abs(sum($row$ or $col$)$-k$)
\EndFor
\For {\textbf{each} $diagonal$}
    \State $s \gets$ sum($diagonal$)
    \State diff $+= s-k$ \textbf{if} $s>k$ \textbf{else} 0
\EndFor \\
\Return $\exp(-$diff$)$
\EndFunction

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Implementation on GPU}

TODO: How did you implement it on GPU? Differences from general algorithm? Issues?
Memory, etc.? Random number generation issues?

\section{Results}

TODO: Add some nice graphs and tables with running times of CPU vs GPU.

\section{Conclusion}

TOOD: CPU vs GPU best when solving puzzles with state-space search approach? Advantages, 
disadvantages? What needs to be done to solve this kind of problems on GPU's?
